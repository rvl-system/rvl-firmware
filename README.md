# RVL Firmware

Source code for my RVL system, meant to be run on [RVL Controller Boards](https://github.com/rvl-system/rvl-controller-board). Written using [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/).

This project is still under heavy development, documentation coming soon once things have settled!

In the mean time, check out this tech demo video of the hardware (as of July 2018).

And a photo of the system on my bike at Burning Man 2017:

## Notes

The ESP32 sometimes has trouble with Linksys brand routers. If you find that controllers work for a while, then disconnect and never reconnect, try a different router.
